<h2>Video Synopsis via Tracking<br/><br/><small>Final Year Project<br/> Mentor - <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vinaynamboodiri/">Prof. Vinay Namboodiri</a> and <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof K.S. Venkatesh</a> (July 2014 - Present)</small></h2>

<p>
    Video Synopsis of Surveillance Videos is an interesting and very practical concept. Toning down hours of video into a bunch of images for each object, brings down the effort of surveillance tape examiners. We propose a method of summarizing a video using the state of the art Kernel-based tracking methods. After initializing the trackers via foreground detection, we obtain the tracks of each object. Occlusion in these tracks is taken into account before generating a synopsis. <b>Future Work: </b> Currently, tracker poses issues of non-scalability of bounding boxes, solving which is the next plan-of-action. <b><a href="files/report_ugp.pdf">[Report]</a></b>

<h2>A Complex Matrix Factorization approach to Joint Modeling of Magnitude and Phase for Source Separation<br/><br/><small>Undergraduate Researcher at <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</b><br/>Mentor - <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rhegde/">Prof. Rajesh Hegde</a> (July - Nov 2014)</small></h2>

<p>
 Conventional NMF methods for source separation factorize the matrix of spectral magnitudes. Spectral Phase is not included in the decomposition process of these methods. However, phase of the speech mixture is generally used in reconstructing the target speech signal. This results in undesired traces of interfering sources in the target signal. In this work the spectral phase is incorporated in the decomposition process itself. Additionally, the complex matrix factorization problem is reduced to an NMF problem using simple transformations. This results in effective separation of speech mixtures since both magnitude and phase are utilized jointly in the separation process. Improvement in source separation results are demonstrated using objective quality evaluations on the GRID corpus. <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rhegde/chdemo.html"><b>[Website]</b></a>

<h2>Prediction of Adjectives for given Nouns using Probability distribution of Word Similarities<br/><br/><small>Internship at <b>Cornell University</b> <br/> Mentor - <a href="http://www.ece.cornell.edu/people/profile.cfm?netid=tc345">Prof. Tsuhan Chen</a> (May - July 2014)</small></h2>

<p>
  Adjective prediction is a complex task in the field of Natural Language Processing. Using an existing set of tags, extracted from a given image and user similarities, we designed a system to predict adjectives for a given noun. The current literature on predictive text analysis was explored, which directed us to a statistical model rather than a rule-based model. We incorporated a Sentence Corpus(British National Corpus) to improve the compatibility of adjectives with nouns. To reduce the time complexity of the process, redundant data was removed from the corpus to create a network for easy access of noun-adjective pair scores. The vision of this project was to improve the vocabulary of the predicted adjectives while maintaining the sanctity of the noun-adjective pair. <b><a href="files/report_cornell.pdf">[Report]</a></b>

<h2>On-Line modeling of the Pinna for Computation of HRTFs in Rendering 3D Audio<br/><br/><small>Undergraduate Researcher at <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</b> <br/>Mentor - <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rhegde/">Prof. Rajesh Hegde</a> (May 2013 - Present)</small></h2>

<p>
  The vision of this project was to find relations between structure of the ear and HRTFs for artificial synthesis of spatial audio. After preliminary testing of spatial audio, issues that needed improvement were recongnized. HRTF bears immense significance in perception of spatial audio, hence reconstruction of personalized HRTF acted as a subproblem to solve the bigger problem at hand. A new signal processing method, which used linear prediction residual cepstrum, was proposed to find spectral notch frequencies (important feature in HRTFs) more accurately. Another aspect of improving resolution of HTRFs was handled in the median plane by Fourier-Bessel series interpolation.
