<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><h2>Counselling Service</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to the general welfare of the freshers, I gave my voluntary support to <b>Counselling Service</b> as a <b>Student Guide</b> (2012-13). I was responsible for helping a group of 6 alloted freshers transition from high-school to college life. Along with mental and emotional support, I put in my efforts more as a friend than a mentor to help them feel comfortable in hostel life. </p>
</li>
<li>Following my <b>passion for teaching</b>, I volunteered as an <b>Academic Mentor</b> (2012-13) and as a <b>Senior Academic Mentor</b> (2013-14). This gave me an opportunity to take tutorial-form extra-classes for my colleagues who could not cope up with fast paced courses in our curriculum. I also had the opportunity to help some students on a one-on-one basis. Overall, imparting knowledge to my peers while learning with them was an amazing experience and this gave me <b>immense satisfaction</b> as a person and a <b>wannabe educator</b>. 
</li>

<li>
I designed and managed the <a href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/counsel/">"Freshmen Forum"</a> for IIT Kanpur. Though this forum remains closed for most of the year, but comes in handy during the pre-orientation period for Freshmen to get answers to specific queries regarding anything related to IIT Kanpur. 

</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Electronics Club</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>  I have had a wonderful relationship with Electronics Club during my formitive years of college education. With Tech-Enthusiasts flooding, I perfectly fit in the club and engaged excellent interaction with people of similar tastes and love for technology. My understanding of practical application of <b>state-of-the-art technology</b> started with implementation of circuits with basic components such as amplifiers, counters etc. This prompted me to <b>participate in various competitions</b> including Embedded Circuit Design, On-the-Spot Circuit Design and FPGA. </p>
<p> Some of the problem statements were very interesting and kept me engaged for days and nights together. Efforts did bear fruit and we were awarded prizes in various national level events.</p>
<ul><li><b>FPGA Design Challenge</b> (Independent Project in Techkriti 2014) - <b>First Position</b> </li>
<li><b>Annotrix</b> (on the spot circuit design in Techkriti 2014) - <b>First Position</b> </li>
<li><b>"Labyrinth"</b> Maze Game (independent project in Techkriti 2013) - <b> Fifth Position</b></li>

</ul>  </li>

<li><h2>DUGC Student Nominee</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>One of the 2 students</b> to be selected as the student nominee in the DUGC committee of the Electrical Engineering Department (2014-15).
</li>
<li>This committee is involved in general decisions related to department problems. My role is <b>putting up grievances of students</b> in the meetings and coming up with <b>possible solutions</b> with the team of DUGC memebers
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<li><h2>Editor-Vox Populi (2014-15)</h2>
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://voxiitk.com/">Vox Populi</a> is a campus newspaper which publishes articles on issues ranging from environment degradation to reporting events. Views of campus residents forms an essential portion of the paper.
</li>
<li> As an editor, I am responsible for writing on pressing issues in the campus to raise awareness amongst my fellow residents and fight for change through the power of words.
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><h2>Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
<li> <b>Music</b> forms an integral part of my life. Be it indulging in Indian Classical by practicing <b>flute</b> or listening to Led Zeppelin, Amit Trivedi (and many others) or even <b>whistling</b> my favourite cover songs, I cannot be separated from music.
</li> 
<li>Enthused by sports my whole life, I have tried every sport that has come my way. <b>Badminton, Squash, Basketball, Swimming</b> and <b>Pool</b>(a recent addition to my list) are a few sports which excite more than others. 
</li>
<li>I am a <b>coin enthusiast</b>. Even after having collected coins of more than 15 countries, the sight of a new coin brings a smile to my face.
</li>
<li> Other than that, I love <b>travelling</b>, not just for the sake of the destination, but to meet new people and understand their culture.
</li>
