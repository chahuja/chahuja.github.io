            I am Chaitanya, a PhD student at the <a href="https://http://lti.cs.cmu.edu/"> Language Technologies Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/"> Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (LP)</a> in the <a href="http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/"> Multicomp Lab</a> and we work on anything multimodal. Every modality has something to offer and we try to make sure that every modality's voice (pun intended) is heard.
